## <ins> About </ins>
I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing majors in Quantitative Economics and Finance. My primary fields of interests are in quantitative analysis and algorithmic trading. Also, I actively trade in the stock market. The majority of my projects will be in Python with C++ and SQL occasionally.
